Toby - A tinywiny MVC framework
==================


Description
-----------

Hey there. Toby is a small MVC framework for Apache and PHP.

I've built this to have a quick and versatile starting point when creating web applications. At this time it is poorly documented. So if you want to have a try with it and get stuck. Don't bother to contact me.


Installation
------------

These are only the core files. For installation with my bootstrap setup navigate to http://github.com/Tbstr/toby-bootstrap and follow the instructions there.
